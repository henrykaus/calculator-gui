# CalculatorGUI
An expression-based calculator

This program was specifically compiled and created using IntelliJ Idea with Maven
to create fat Jars. The source code is included in the "src" directory and could
be plopped into IntelliJ with a 11.0.12 jdk for a smooth experience. Pngs are also
included for icons in the GUI-based application.

  1) In IntelliJ IDEA, double tap ctrl
  2) type command "mvn clean"
  3) type command "mvn install"
  4) Shaded executable fat jar will be in CalculatorGUI/target folder.
